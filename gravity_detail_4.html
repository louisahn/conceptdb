                        How much you weigh depends on where you are. If you were floating out in space, you would be weightless. This means that if you stepped on a scale, the scale would say that your weight is zero.

                           But if you were on another world, your weight would not be zero. Your weight would depend on the gravitational pull of that world. For example, Mars has a gravitational pull that is .4 of Earth's. If you weigh 120 pounds on Earth, then you would weigh 48 pounds on Mars.

                            Does this sound like it can get confusing? It certainly does. That’s why scientists talk about the mass of an object rather than its weight. On Earth, the mass of an object is equal to its weight.

                            However, when you leave the Earth, an object’s weight changes depending on the gravitational pull being exerted on it. But, its mass doesn’t change. An object’s mass is the same, no matter where it is in the universe. Using mass makes it much easier for scientists to compare objects that may be located in different places in the universe.
